# Understanding Different Mediation Styles

Mediation is an effective tool for resolving conflicts. However, there are different mediation styles that mediators can use to help parties reach a resolution. In this chapter, we will discuss the various mediation styles and how to develop mediation skills.

Understanding Mediation Styles
------------------------------

1. Facilitative Mediation: This style focuses on communication and understanding. The mediator helps parties communicate effectively and reach mutual understanding. The mediator encourages parties to generate options and solutions that meet their interests.

2. Evaluative Mediation: This style involves the mediator evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each party's case. The mediator then provides feedback and makes recommendations on how to resolve the conflict.

3. Transformative Mediation: This style focuses on empowering parties to understand and address their underlying issues. The mediator helps parties identify and express their needs and feelings in a supportive environment. The goal is to transform the relationship between parties and create a more positive future.

4. Narrative Mediation: This style involves the mediator helping parties create a shared narrative of the conflict. The mediator encourages parties to examine their own perspectives and understand the other party's perspective. The goal is to create a better understanding of the conflict and find a resolution.

Developing Mediation Skills
---------------------------

1. Listening: Effective mediators listen actively and with empathy. They pay attention to verbal and nonverbal cues to understand the emotions and needs of each party.

2. Communication: Mediators should be able to communicate clearly and effectively. They should also be able to ask open-ended questions, summarize information, and reframe issues to facilitate understanding.

3. Creativity: Mediators should be able to think creatively and generate new options and solutions. They should also be able to encourage parties to think outside the box and come up with innovative solutions.

4. Empathy: Mediators should be able to understand and empathize with the emotions and needs of each party. They should create a safe and supportive environment for parties to express their feelings.

5. Neutrality: Mediators should remain neutral throughout the mediation process. They should not take sides or make decisions for parties.

Conclusion

Developing mediation skills is essential for effective conflict resolution. Understanding different mediation styles and developing key skills such as listening, communication, creativity, empathy, and neutrality can help mediators guide parties towards a successful resolution.
